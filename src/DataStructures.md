# DataStructures

Elements to Compare DataStructures

1) Time complexity \theta

2) Memory allocation 

3) Inserting an element 

4) Deletion of an element

##### Array: 

		*  Fixed Size with one contigues block
		*   Read a data from array  is \theta (1)
		*   Memory allocation is  \theta (n)
		*  Insertion at beginning \theta (n)
		*  Insertion at end \theta (1)
		*  Insertion at ith position is \theta (n)

#### Linked List:

	* Node will have two variables one with value and other with the address pointed to the next element of the list.
	* Read a data is \theta (n)
	* Memory allocation is \theta (n)
	* Insertion at beginning \theta (1)
  * Insertion at end \theta (n)
  * Insertion at ith position is \theta (n)
