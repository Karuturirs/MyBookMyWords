#####   :factory: Set Up:

0. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

1. :two_men_holding_hands: ​Creating docker network bridge

   ``` docker network create -d bridge mongodb```

   ✔️ check if all is well:

   ​	``` docker network ls ```

2. :minidisc: Mongodb container setup

   ```cmd
   docker run -it -p 27017:27017 --network=mongodb --mount source=mock,destination=/data/db/ --name mocktail-bird-mongo mongo:3.6.11-stretch
   ```
   ​	<i>* network mongodb should be the one given as from the step 1 creating docker network driver.</i>

   ​	<i>* name mocktail-bird-mongo is the name of mongodb container.</i>

3. :closed_lock_with_key: ​DB Authentication.

   ``` docker exec -it mocktail-bird-mongo /bin/bash```

   the above command opens the conatiner folder and run ```mongo``` command. That will make you enter to mongodb console. enter below command to create a user to access the <b>mocktail</b> db

   ``` mongo js
   // enter into admin db
   use admin;
   db.getUsers();
   //create admin user to create new user and roles
   db.createUser({
       user: "mockbird",
       pwd: "Ilovethisbird",
       roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "admin" },
       				{ role: "read", db: "reporting" } ]}
   );
   //create user to read, write record to moctail db
   db.createUser({
       user: "adam",
       pwd: "adamjohn",
       roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "mocktail" },
                { role: "read", db: "reporting" } ]
     }
   );
   //Authenticat the user
   db.auth("adam","adamjohn")
   ```

   ✔️ check if mongodb conatiner created:

   ​	 ```docker ps -a```

   ​	<i>* If this container is restarted all the data is lost and all the steps 2,3 needs to be done again. Will be implementing —volume of docker container soon to avoid data loss.</i>


4. 💸 Starting mocktail-bird application container

   ```cmd
     docker run -it -p 9080:9080 --network=mongodb --name mockatail-bird-qa mocktailbird/mocktail-bird:qa
   ```
   <i>	* network connects db and this application container.</i>
   <i> * name of this conatiner is mockatail-bird-qa.</i>
   <i>	* mocktailbird/mocktail-bird:qa  is the docker hub image for conatiner creation</i>

5. ✔️ Check application running.
